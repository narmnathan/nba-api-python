A statistical model and data scraper for retrieving statistics on various NBA players. Currently written in Python and R.
## Installation
Reference **sinix_guide.ipynb** for installation guide.
## End-Goal
Analytics are utilized and compared to give a strength rating ranging from -1 to +1 to determine the level at which an NBA player will play; i.e. -1 indicates a negative performance and +1 positive. Player profiles are provided with certain traits that can be plotted and compared in order to provide statistics necessary for player analyses.
## Roadmap:
- Update main.py with new dataset and introduce SQL functionality
- Implement analysis variables into analysis.R
